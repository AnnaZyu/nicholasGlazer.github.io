I like new stuff, but I respect older. I prefer terminal to GUI, Arch Linux to Ubuntu, Emacs to Sublime text, Dvorak to QWERTY, MVI to MVC, ES6 to subsets, webpack to gulp. I consider that ES6 and the libraries like Cycle.js, React or Angular2 is the right way to move on. Libraries like Redux and Immutableljs makes web even better with predictible states, showing us a new way to think of our apps.",
